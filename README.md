# PneumoVision

# PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Pneumonia is a serious and often life-threatening respiratory illness that affects millions of people 
worldwide. It is caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which can 
lead to inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. However, traditional methods of pneumonia 
detection, such as manual interpretation of chest X-rays by radiologists, can be labor-intensive and 
subjective. Early and accurate detection of pneumonia is crucial for effective treatment and 
management, as delayed diagnosis can result in severe complications and even death.  
# SOLUTION 
Pneumonia is most common in underdeveloped and developing countries, where overpopulation, 
pollution, and unhygienic environmental conditions exacerbate the situation, and medical 
resources are scanty. Therefore, early diagnosis and management can play a pivotal role in 
preventing the disease from becoming fatal. Radiological examination of the lungs using computed 
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or radiography (X-rays) is frequently used 
for diagnosis. 
Deep Learning is one of the scientific fields in Computer Science that actually helps the application 
to learn from pre-defined experiences. The Deep Learning domain is very useful for the prediction 
of diseases in an individual by datasets that were learned by the application using Deep Learning. 
Pneumonia detection using Deep Learning actually predicts the using the dataset and algorithms 
for better accuracy and precise results. 
Since this project solely depends upon two domains i.e., Deep Learning and Web Page 
Development, there would be a lot of challenging tasks will be present in the project.  
Our Project is built strategically by collecting various datasets of unique valued attributes for 
accurate results. This project, PneumoVision seeks to address these challenges by harnessing the 
power of deep learning to automate the detection of pneumonia from medical images.  
# AIMS & OBJECTIVES 
 AIM  
The ultimate aim of this project, ‘PneumoVision’ is to develop a system or a model which can 
actually detect pneumonia with chest X-ray with higher accuracy results by combining different 
Deep Learning Algorithms such as  - CNN Algorithm  - DenseNet  - VGG - ResNet - Inception Net (GoogLeNet) 
Each Algorithm is undertaken for accuracy purposes, the one with the best accuracy results and 
precise prediction will be taken into account as a model. 
 OBJECTIVES 
The main Objectives of this project ‘PneumoVision’ are: 
1. Fast and Reliable Results using Deep Learning. 
2. Web Page for User Convenience. 
3. Time-Saving and Cost Reliable.
# SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION
To successfully develop the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for pneumonia detection 
PneumoVision project, the project team will need to fulfill several key requirements. First and 
foremost, they will require access to a large, high-quality dataset of chest X-ray images, both from 
patients with confirmed pneumonia and those with healthy lungs. This dataset will serve as the 
foundation for training and validating the CNN model, ensuring its accuracy and robustness. 
In addition to the image dataset, the project will require a powerful computing infrastructure 
capable of handling the intensive training process of the deep learning model. This may involve 
the use of specialized hardware, such as high-performance GPUs, to accelerate the training and 
inference stages of the CNN. Furthermore, the team will need to have access to advanced deep 
learning libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, which provide the necessary 
tools and functions for building, training, and deploying the CNN model. 
# TOOLS 
• ANACONDA – JUPYTER NOTEBOOK: Anaconda is a popular platform for scientific 
computing that includes Python and various data science libraries. Jupyter Notebook allows 
researchers to create interactive documents that combine code, explanations, and visualizations, 
making it ideal for developing and experimenting with the CNN model. 
• VS CODE: While Jupyter Notebook excels in interactive coding, VS Code is a versatile code 
editor known for its customization options, debugging tools, and support for various programming 
languages, including Python. This makes it a valuable tool for writing and editing the Python code 
used to build and train the CNN model.   
# FRONT END & BACK END 
• PYTHON: As the primary programming language for the project, Python offers powerful 
libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and scientific computing. It allows the team to 
develop all aspects of the model, from data preprocessing to building and training the CNN. 
• HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT: While the core functionalities reside in Python, these web 
development technologies are used to create a user interface (UI) for the PneumoVision project. 
The UI could allow users to upload chest X-ray images and receive predictions from the trained 
CNN model. 
# ARCHITECTURE  
PneumoVision can be implemented in many algorithms of Deep Learning. So, we have chosen 
some of the algorithms and started to implement each one in a separate environment to test their 
efficiency, time consumption, and accuracy results. There are 5 Algorithms we initially used here: 
CNN, ResNet , DenseNet , GoogLeNet , VGG.
